# Math Viewer

Math Viewer is a **React Native App** where you can interact with some math concepts.

The app has three major features:

## Viewer

With **Viewer**, you can choose a math formula, fill it and see "visually" what this formula represents or returns.
## Homeworks

Here, you can practice your math skills by doing some excercices. For each completed excercise you will earn a couple of ***Mathscore*** points.
## Mathscore

Mathscore is the app score system. It allows you to know how are you doing with your exercises and compare with other users by our ranking system.
